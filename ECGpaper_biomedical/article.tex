\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
% or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
% will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
% driver is specified.
% \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[cmintegrals]{newtxmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig


% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

		In this paper, we proposed a novel predictive modeling algorithms which is based on a designed spatial transformation.

	\section{Introduction}
	%Recently, incidence of heart diseases increase sharply as a result of aging of population, chronic cardiovascular diseases, increasing life stress and continuously accelerating pace of life. According to incomplete statistics, about 1/3 of global deaths are caused by heart diseases. The annual death toll of coronary heart disease in the United States accounts for 14.7\% of total deaths.
	
	As a result of population aging, life stress increasing and accelerating pace of life, the incidence of fatal spontaneous disease such as cardiovascular disease has been increasing sharply, becoming one of the main mortality causes in worldwide\cite{mortality}. Biomedical signals, as a non-invasive method, are investigated broadly by researchers to design automated analysis and real-time monitoring systems. In the past decades, various biomedical signal analysis systems are proposed. Whereas applying conventional classification algorithms on biomedical signals remains challenging, especially for applications of spontaneous disease detection. The main drawbacks of the existing systems are due to the following two features. 
	
	One important character of biomedical signal waveforms is its variability caused by distinct physical conditions of different individuals (i.e. gender, age, body-mass index etc.)\cite{agesex}\cite{intervaria}. Conventional classification algorithms fall short of generalization when applying on different patients' records. 
	
	To address this issue, some innovative patient-specific classification systems are proposed \cite{Hu_et_al}\cite{deChazal2006}\cite{Kiranyaz}. Hu et al. proposed a patient-specific mixture of experts (MOE) classifier by incorporating personalized annotations provided cardiologists in the local classifier \cite{Hu_et_al}. This methods achieves patient-adapting capacity but requires further input from human experts. %This MOE approach achieved an accuracy of 94.0% for distinguishing VEBs from non-VEBs.
	Following the design of MOE, de Chazal and B. Reilly proposed an improved patient-adapting classifier by reducing the requirement of manual annotations to as few as 10 beats for training adaptive local classifier. %The gross performance of our system using 500 beats(15.5\%) to adapt on the same recordings was an accuracy 99.2\%, sensitivity 94.4\%, positive predictivity 98.4\%, and FPR of 0.2\% for distinguishing VEB from non-VEB heartbeats on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.
	Based on 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNN), Kiranyaz et al. proposed a flexible algorithm which adjusts its parameters using information extracted from individual signal\cite{Kiranyaz}. The classifier demonstrates consistent performance over different ECG records %achieving an accuracy between 98\% ~ 99\% for distinguishing VEBs from non-VEBs. (Acc = 98.9\%  Sen = 95.9\% Spe =  99.4\%)
	While this approach outperforms the aforementioned classification algorithms as it does not require expert further annotations, its performance reduces for some rare abnormal classes.
	
	Another typical feature of signals for spontaneous disease is abnormality occurrence without obvious premonitory symptoms, which leads to the lack of effective therapeutic intervention beforehand and a high mortality rate of the disease. Therefore, a timely detection or prediction capacity is of great importance for automatic analysis systems. 
	
	In order to overcome this unpredictability, systems with advanced warning or predicting capacity are proposed in some recent researches. In \cite{advancewarning}, Kiranyaz et al. proposed an abnormal beat synthesis approach to map normal beats to potential abnormal beats and thus generate analysis results in advance. The goal of normal-to-abnormal mapping is to model potential causes for spontaneous cardiac diseases. %The performance of warning on three consecutive abnormal beats are discussed, showing a promising 99.4% accuracy.
	In our previous work\cite{chen2018predictive}, the specific spatial topology of normal and abnormal clusters was analyzed in order to model the trajectory of ECG samples evolving from normal status to abnormal. These two methods share a common concept of modeling the intermediate states from complete normal to abnormal state. 
	
	While the aforementioned systems demonstrated capacity of predicting upcoming abnormalities, it's hard to interpret the mechanisms of the systems and thus hindering the generalization of predictive warning to other applications of biomedical signals.
	
	Having analyzed the symmetric encircled topology in our previous work, we proposed a novel spatial transformation based predictive modeling system to assist cardiologist take advanced therapeutic innervation. The system consists of four essential parts: data preparation, forming personalized normal cluster, tuning parameters of spatial transformation and predicting with transformed data. This paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:prepro} briefly introduces the overview of data set deployed in this paper; Section \ref{sec:overview} summarizes the overall workflow of the system including the formation of personalized normal cluster; Section \ref{sec:spatial} includes three proposed methods for designed spatial transformation; Section\ref{sec:result} demonstrates the results by deploying the system on benchmark ECG data; %different biomedical signal
	Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the system and proposes potential applications of this approach.
	
	\section{Data Preparation}
	
	The main goal of this stage is to extract informative features from biomedical signal, mapping the signal from its raw form to a single sample in the feature space. As an important biomedical signal for diagnosing cardiac disease, electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used to design and test classifiers. In particular, the benchmark data MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database\cite{mitdb} (MITDB) is recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) \cite{aami} for reporting classification performance. Following the standardized AAMI recommended practice, the annotations of MITDB are further grouped into 4 major classes: class N(normal and bundle branch block beat types) class V(ventricular type), class S(supraventricular type) and class F(fusion of normal and ventricular types). In this paper, ECG lead A is adopted and the database is further split into test and training set by balancing the four major classes of ECG according to \cite{autofs}. The data preparation for ECG signal is composed of signal preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction.
